# SECURE FILE SHARING USING CRYPTOGRAPHY IN MERN STACK 
# OVERVIEW
    In today’s digital landscape, where data breaches and unauthorized access are constant threats, having a secure method for file sharing is more important than ever. The proposed system addresses these concerns head-on by offering a comprehensive and secure file-sharing platform built using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This modern tech stack allows for a scalable, fast, and flexible web application. What sets this system apart is its strong emphasis on data security, user authentication, and access control.
      At the heart of the system lies the use of AES-256 encryption, a robust cryptographic method that ensures that all files are protected both at rest and in transit. This means that even if an unauthorized party somehow gains access to the stored data, it would be useless without the decryption key. Encryption is seamlessly integrated into the user flow, allowing users to securely upload and share files without needing advanced technical knowledge. The system is designed to be user-friendly while upholding the highest standards of security.
User access is governed through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which clearly distinguishes between Admin, User, and Guest roles. Each role has specific permissions and limitations, particularly in terms of how many files they can share and how they can interact with the system. This ensures that sensitive features remain restricted to authorized individuals, preventing misuse or accidental data leaks. For instance, guests are given only one-time access, which makes this ideal for one-off file transfers where longer-term sharing isn’t required.
File sharing is done through secure, signed URLs—unique, cryptographically signed links that cannot be tampered with. These links are further protected with OTP (One-Time Password) verification, and are time-bound with a strict 5-minute expiration period. This multi-layered approach reduces the risk of unauthorized access and ensures that only the intended recipient, at the intended time, can open the file. The inability to download or re-share these files adds an extra layer of protection, especially in sensitive contexts like legal, corporate, or personal data sharing.
